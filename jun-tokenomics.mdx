## **Background and Purpose**

**Junction Token (\$JUN)** will be the native utility token powering the Junction ecosystem, which includes all Junction’s products, currently entitled with **Junction Exchange** and **Junction API**. The token will be issued as an ERC-20 standard, \$JUN will enables cross-platform compatibility, offering seamless integration with major wallets, DeFi protocols, and a broad range of decentralised applications (dApps) on Ethereum.

The goal is to unify \$JUN distribution by consolidating its initial token offering, Junction made it easier for users to interact with multiple services, bridging the decentralised world of digital asset trading with the dynamic, permissionless universe of DeFi. The ERC-20 foundation is strategically chosen to maximize liquidity, interoperability, and to ensure easy adoption across various sectors of the crypto economy.

## **Utility and Use Cases**

JUN’s value is deeply embedded in the utility it offers throughout the Junction services:

- **Transactional Fee Discounts:** \$JUN holders receive substantial discounts on trading fees across Junction’s vast range of crypto products, including trading, earning and on/off ramp features.
- **Staking and Yield Generation:** Users will be able to stake their \$JUN tokens in the Junction Earn section to gain passive income, incentivising long-term engagement and effectively reducing circulating supply.
- **Launchpad Participation:** \$JUN acts as a ticket for platform Launchpad events, granting holders early access to crypto launches and allowing them to earn rewards from promising new projects Junction will be investing in - fully on-chain and automated.
- **Gas payment:** Junction Exchange and Junction API will be able to be “gas free” leveraging the \$JUN token as a payment rail, eliminating gas as a friction to navigate ecosystems and make trading more simple.

## **Token Supply**

JUN’s supply will launch at **100 million tokens**.

The initial tokenomics structure prioritise platform growth and longevity, allocating tokens to development, community incentives, partner rewards, operations, airdrop and reserve funds.

| **Category**             | **Allocation** | **Tokens** | **Vesting Details**                              |
| :----------------------- | :------------- | :--------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Ecosystem fund           | 45%            | 45,000,000 | no cliff, 10% unlock TGE, 2 years linear vesting |
| Team                     | 20%            | 20,000,000 | no cliff, 10% unlock TGE, 2 years linear vesting |
| Pre-seed                 | 12%            | 12,000,000 | no cliff, 10% unlock TGE, 2 years linear vesting |
| Airdrop                  | 10%            | 10,000,000 | unlocked, but distributed over seasons           |
| Partners/Community funds | 10%            | 10,000,000 | unlocked                                         |
| Advisors                 | 3%             | 3,000,000  | no cliff, 10% unlock TGE, 2 years linear vesting |

_Note: allocation pourcentage might have a little variation depending of the pre-seed/seed rounds final allocation - every update will be share in advance - total airdrop pourcentage is fixed._

## **Governance**

Junction will empowers \$JUN holders with **governance rights**, entitling them to vote on platform decisions that can shape the ecosystem’s future. These include:

- Deciding on major parameters changes (fee percentage, revenue sharing percentage..)
- Approving major feature upgrades or policy changes
- Allocating budgets for grants and community initiatives

Governance proposals can originate from either Junction’s internal team or the wider community, with voting power proportionate to **\$JUN** holdings. The transparent, on-chain voting system reduces the risk of manipulation and puts meaningful control in the hands of the community, further decentralising the project’s management.

## **Security, Transparency, and the Road Ahead**

**\$JUN** leverages Ethereum’s security standards and is protected through regular smart contract audits, multi-signature wallets, and cold storage practices at the exchange and wallet levels. Junction maintains transparency by publishing details and on-chain proofs of major events such as burns and distribution changes.

Looking forward, the team has a roadmap focused on enhanced cross-chain compatibility, deeper integration with emerging DeFi protocols, and incremental shifts toward greater decentralisation in governance. All these initiatives are designed to strengthen JUN’s value proposition and drive user growth.

## **Summary**

In summary, **Junction Token (\$JUN)** will be a foundational piece of the Junction ecosystem, underpinning decentralised operations. Its utility-driven, deflationary, and transparent structure will provide tangible benefits to users, fosters engagement, and keeps long-term incentives aligned. As **Junction** continues to evolve, **\$JUN** will stands out as a robust tool for accessing, shaping, and growing the future of crypto finance.
